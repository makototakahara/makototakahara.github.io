Hello! I am Makoto Takahara, a statistics student at the University of Toronto. I was born in Japan but bounced around Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, and Canada.

One of my personal passions is baseball: I played for 12 years, I love watching (on a mission to visit all 30 MLB stadiums), and I have a small collection of baseball caps and memorabilia.

In fact, my interest in statistics was sparked by baseball, where data is used to isolate and evaluate player performance. My journey in statistics has taken me into new domains such as societal well-being and finance. 

This website is intended, in part, as a portfolio showcasing my projects, capturing the essence of my statistical adventures across various exciting fields!
