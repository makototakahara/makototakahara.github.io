  Hello and welcome to my website! I am Makoto Takahara, a statistics student at the University of Toronto. I was born in Japan but have also bounced around the United States, Hong Kong, and Canada. <br/>
  <br/>
  One of my personal passions is baseball. In fact, my interest in statistics was sparked by baseball, where data is used to evaluate player performance. My journey in statistics has taken me into new domains such as societal well-being and finance. Feel free to explore my projects that capture the essence of my statistical adventures across various exciting fields!<br/>
