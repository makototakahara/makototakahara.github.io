What does your bucket list look like? Here's a peek at the top of mine.

**Makoto's (Short Term) Bucket List:**
- [ ] Visit all 30 Major League Baseball (MLB) stadiums
- [ ] Make a mountain of nachos directly on a table, then eat it
- [X] Eat toasted grasshoppers with a celebrity
- [ ] Create a personal website
- [ ]  ...

Since baseball season is on hold, I can't make any progress on #1. 
Recently, many people have been asking me if I gained weight, so it would be wise to hold off #2 for the time being.
(Un)fortunately, I managed to check #3 off of my list.

So here I am, writing a first blog post for my personal website. 
While we're on the topic, I want to circle back to #1 and talk about my goal of visiting all 30 MLB stadiums.

## How my dream came to be. 
It all started in 2016, when I came across an Instagram post about the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Japanese superstars were set to go up against their international counterparts in Tokyo, an epic crossover that I could not afford to miss as a fan of both MLB and NPB. Unfortunately, I lived in Hong Kong at the time, with no money to my name and no solo travelling experience. 

After researching the cheapest HK Express tickets and capsule hotels, I pitched the trip to my father as an low-cost, high-return investment in my personal growth. To be frank, I wasn't sure what that growth was going to look like, but my enthusiasm and initiative was enough to convince my father.

Turns out, it was a great investment indeed. I had the time of my life, watching a back-and-forth game between Team Japan and Team Netherlands. I met some fellow baseball enthusiasts from around the world, explored the city (one year later, I moved to Tokyo!), and went home with an Andrelton Simmons autograph. Most importantly, it showed me that travelling for baseball is more than *just* watching baseball. It blended together some of my favorite aspect of life - meeting new people, watching baseball, travelling, local food & culture - into one. 

My parents had taken me to a few MLB stadiums in my childhood - Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium, Petco Park, T-Mobile Park (then known as Safeco Field), and Yankee Stadium. So upon returning to North America for college in 2021, I set a goal of visiting the rest of the stadiums before graduation. And that is how an Instagram post from 2016 inspired a series of life defining trips that have been some of the most memorable days of my life. 

## Leg 1: Toronto

My MLB stadium adventure started right in my own backyard - Toronto. As I settled into the city in September 2021, I went to the Rogers Centre with some friends from college who happen to be huge Blue Jays fans. With the roof open, the CN tower overlooks a crisp Toronto autumn night at the Rogers Centre. 

The Rogers Centre is my favorite place in Toronto. Having experienced everything from bonding with friends over a beer to watching the Jays melt down in the playoffs, it feels like home to me now. One day, I want to watch a game from the Marriott embedded in the stadium - then finally, it would quite literally feel like home. 

## Leg 2: Chicago, Milwaukee, Boston 

## Leg 3: Seattle 

## Leg 4: San Francisco, Oakland

## Leg 5: Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit
