What does your bucket list look like? Here's a peek at the top of mine.

**Makoto's (Short Term) Bucket List:**
 - [ ] Visit all 30 Major League Baseball (MLB) stadiums
 - [ ] Make a mountain of nachos directly on a table, then eat it
 - [X] Eat toasted grasshoppers with a celebrity
 - [ ] Create a personal website
 - [ ]  ...

Since baseball season is on hold, I can't make any progress on #1. 
Recently, many people have been asking me if I gained weight, so it would be wise to hold off #2 for the time being.
(Un)fortunately, I managed to check #3 off of my list.

So here I am, writing a first blog post for my personal website. 
While we're on the topic, I want to circle back to #1 and talk about my goal of visiting all 30 MLB stadiums.

## How my dream came to be. 
It all started in 2016, when I came across an Instagram post about the 2017 World Baseball Classic. Japanese superstars were set to go up against their international counterparts in Tokyo, an epic crossover that I could not afford to miss as a fan of both MLB and NPB. Unfortunately, I lived in Hong Kong at the time, with no money to my name and no solo travelling experience. 

After researching the cheapest HK Express tickets and capsule hotels, I pitched the trip to my father as an low-cost, high-return investment in my personal growth. To be frank, I wasn't sure what that growth was going to look like, but my enthusiasm and initiative was enough to convince my father.

Turns out, it was a great investment indeed. I had the time of my life, watching a back-and-forth game between Team Japan and Team Netherlands. I met some fellow baseball enthusiasts from around the world, explored the city (one year later, I moved to Tokyo!), and went home with an Andrelton Simmons autograph. Most importantly, it showed me that travelling for baseball is more than *just* watching baseball. It blended together some of my favorite aspect of life - meeting new people, watching baseball, travelling, local food & culture - into one. 

My parents had taken me to a few MLB stadiums in my childhood - Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium, Petco Park, T-Mobile Park (then known as Safeco Field), and Yankee Stadium. So upon returning to North America for college in 2021, I set a goal of visiting the rest of the stadiums before graduation. And that is how an Instagram post from 2016 inspired a series of life defining trips that have been some of the most memorable days of my life. 

## Leg 1: Toronto

My MLB stadium adventure started right in my own backyard - Toronto. As I settled into the city in September 2021, I went to the Rogers Centre with some friends from college who happen to be huge Blue Jays fans. With the roof open, the CN tower overlooks a crisp Toronto autumn night at the Rogers Centre. 

The Rogers Centre is now my favorite place in Toronto. Having experienced everything from bonding with friends over a beer to watching the Jays melt down in the playoffs, it feels like home to me now. One day, I want to watch a game from the Marriott embedded in the stadium - then finally, it would quite literally feel like home. 

## Leg 2: Chicago, Milwaukee, Boston 
Every baseball fan wants to visit Fenway Park and Wrigley Field, the two oldest and most legendary ballparks in MLB. When I saw that the Angels were playing in Chigago and Boston on a roadtrip, I immediately knew where my next trip was going to take me.

Yep you guessed it, Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the Chicago White Sox. My plan was to watch the Angels-White Sox series, catch a game at Wrigley Field for the Crosstown Classic, then follow the Angels to Boston for a few games at Fenway Park. These trips require meticulous planning, especially if there are specific teams or games you want to catch. The point being, Fenway and Wrigley would have to wait just a tad bit longer.

My time in the South Side of Chicago was defined by its welcoming people. My most memorable interactions include strategizing with autograph collectors to get Shohei Ohtani's attention, being treated to drinks from opposing White Sox fans that I newly befriended, and chatting with Angels pitcher Griffin Canning about his return from injury. On another note, the Angels lost. 

My next stop was not Wrigley or Fenway, but American Family Field in Milwaukee. This day-trip to Milwaukee was a spontaneous conception when I realized that it was only a few hours’ train ride. The parking lots at American Family Field transform into a giant barbeque party before each home game. I was fortunate to have some generous locals let me join their festivities, experiencing the tradition of pregame tailgates in Milwaukee. The game was great too, and I got to watch the Cubs’ Seiya Suzuki drive in a much-needed insurance run to secure the win over the Brewers.

But the highlight of this trip came after the game. You see, the Milwaukee Intermodal Station is about an hour away by foot from the stadium. With very little public transportation nearby, I hopped on a random shuttle bus hoping it would get me downtown. Turns out, the shuttle bus went to a restaurant on the other side of town, and I was now an hour and a half away from the station cutting it close to my scheduled departure time. This family who I befriended on the shuttle bus offered me a drink and even let me hitchhike with them to the station. The friendliness and groundedness of the people of Milwaukee made this the best spontaneous decision I’ve ever made.

Thanks to this generous family, I made it back to Chicago to watch the Crosstown Classic the next day at historic Wrigley Field.

Wrigley Field and its surrounding Wrigleyville were nothing short of beautiful. I had heard words of caution against Chicago in the spring, and I did not understand until then. As the freezing rain was pouring down on the Friendly Confines throughout the evening, I was amazed by the energy of the bleachers (some of whom were shirtless). I actually had to miss some of the game to warm up in the heated team store. I rushed to the airport to catch a flight for Boston Logan.

## Leg 3: Seattle 

## Leg 4: San Francisco, Oakland

## Leg 5: Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit
