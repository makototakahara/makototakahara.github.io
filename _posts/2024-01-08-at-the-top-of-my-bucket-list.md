What does your bucket list look like? Here's a peek at the top of mine.

**Makoto's (Short Term) Bucket List:**
- [ ] Visit all 30 MLB stadiums
- [ ] Make a mountain of nachos directly on a table, then eat it
- [X] Eat grasshoppers with a celebrity
- [ ] Create a personal website
- [ ]  ...

Since baseball season is on hold, I can't work on #1. 
Many people have been asking me if I gained weight, so it would be wise to hold off #2 for the time being.
(Un)fortunately, I managed to check #3 off of my list.
So here I am, writing my first blog post for my personal website. 
And while I'm at it, I want to circle back to #1, and talk about my goal of visiting all 30 MLB stadiums.

### How my dream came to be.
