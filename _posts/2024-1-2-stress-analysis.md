# Project Overview
For this project, I worked in a group to investigate the relationship between subjective stress levels and various lifestyle factors.

We used a multiple linear regression to model this relationship with data from Kaggle. This project places an emphasis on testing the assumptions of linear regression, correcting and mitigating violated assumptions, model selection, and analysis of variance (ANOVA).
