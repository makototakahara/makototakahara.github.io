# Project Overview
For this project, I classied celestial objects into galaxies, stars, and quasars.

I used machine learning techniques such as decision trees and random forests to make predictions about the class of celestial object given information about telescope angles, various photometric filters, redshift values, and more. One challenge of this project was my lack of domain knowledge and I learned to learn on the fly about new subjects.
