In this project, I worked in a group to predict the proportion of votes each party recieves in the 2025 Canadian Federal Election. 

I used multilevel regression with postratification, with data from the General Social Survey (GSS), a comprehensive national survey by Statistics Canada, and the 2021 Canadian Election Study (CES), a specialized study focusing on Canadian federal elections.
